Machine Learning Researcher 
RWDI – Independent Contractor, 2025 – Current 
My role was to automate engineer workflows using predictive modelling including both regression, 
classification tasks, and heuristics. 
• Led initiatives to preprocess, clean, and engineer features from large datasets using Python. 
• Collaborated with cross-functional teams (engineering, product management, software 
developers) to identify key pain points in workflows to be automated. 
• Designed and implemented machine learning pipelines, leveraging frameworks such as PyTorch, 
scikit-learn, and xgboost. 
• Research and development of methods for machine learning of 3D structures of buildings 
Computational Biophysicist - Graduate Researcher 
University of Toronto, Toronto, 2017-2025 
My work involved performing simulations on high performance computing systems, analyzing 
biomolecular simulations in python, and communicating findings in scientific journals  
• Designed and executed large-scale molecular simulations to study protein dynamics in diseases 
such as cancer and HIV 
• Specific focus on protein-protein interactions in the context of disease mutations and on protein
polymer interactions and their effect on protein structure and dynamics 
• Developed Python scripts for analysis protein structure & dynamics data from simulations 
• Published 3 peer-reviewed articles, including in Nature Communications and Protein Science, 
showcasing impactful research findings 
• Collaborated with interdisciplinary teams of biologists, chemists, and physicists to cross-validate 
simulation and experimental results 
• Developed visualizations of protein structure, and structural analyses to clearly communicate 
research findings
